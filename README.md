alex cao's homework 1 for rl iems 469 (fall 2020 with prof. klabjan)

# problem 1: 
output figures included

# problem 2:
i simplified the problem by assuming the following: the policy should be such that the most expensive customers (type 5, then 4, etc.) should get on the shuttle first. that way we don't have to worry about the order of customers/combinatorials in the state representation. doing so would mean the state is exponentially large and thus intractable to solve with these methods. all that being said, this code still takes infeasibly long to run
